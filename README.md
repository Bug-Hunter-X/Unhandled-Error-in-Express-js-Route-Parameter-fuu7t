This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for route parameters. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where the route `/users/:id` doesn't handle cases where `id` is invalid.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.
